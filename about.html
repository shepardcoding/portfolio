   <p>I am a former High School Teacher and Football Coach that also coached College Football for two years who career changed in 2014 to IT and have not looked back working my way all the way from Inbound Technical Support to IT Security Analyst.</p>
  <p>Currently, I am teaching myself how to code, so no doubt I am a "Code Newbie".</p>
  <hr>
  <p>My first experience with ANY code was in 1981 on my Atari 800 writing programs in BASIC language.  I remember writing number guessing games, a States and Capitols game, and a math game.  It is little things like that and getting lost in coding with it being therapeutic that has led me to this adventure!</p>
