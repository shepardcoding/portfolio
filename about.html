   <h2>About Me</h2>
   <img class="headshot" src="/images/shep.jpg" alt="this is a selfie of Chris Shepard">
   <p>I am a former High School Teacher and Football Coach that also coached College Football for two years. Now living back in my hometown of Rome, GA, I career changed in 2014 to IT and have not looked back working my way all the way from Inbound Technical Support to IT Security Analyst.</p>
  <p>I am an IT Security Analyst that is currently teaching myself how to code, so no doubt a "Code Newbie".</p>
  <p>My first experience with ANY code was in 1981 on my Atari 800 writing programs in BASIC language.  I remember writing number guessing games, a States and Capitols game, and a math game.  It is little things like that and getting lost in coding with it being therapeutic that has led me to this adventure!</p>

   <p>I am a self-taught IT Security Analyst that is currently self-teaching myself code. My main goal is to move away from IT Security and into
    Development as I have always enjoyed coding, but was intimidated to learn.</p>
   <p>My competencies include HTML5, CSS, basic web creation, leadership.</p>
    <p>I have certifications in CompTia A+, Network+, Security+, Linux+, and I am LPIC-1 certified.</p>
